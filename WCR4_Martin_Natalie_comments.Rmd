## A Poem
Although you hide in the ebb and *flow*

Of the pale tide when the moon has *set*,

The people of coming days will *know*

About the casting out of my *net*,

And how you have leaped times out of *mind*

Over the little silver *cords*,

And think that you were hard and *unkind*,

And blame you with many bitter *words*.

-William Butler Yeats
